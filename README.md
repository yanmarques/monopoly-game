# monopoly game
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yanmarques/monopoly-game.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/yanmarques/monopoly-game)
 
 
 For data structure class.
 
 ### Installation
The game depends on the proposed data structures implementations. You will first download the latest release build,
or source code when you want to build by yourself, go [here](https://github.com/yanmarques/aula-ed/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha). 
  
Now extract it, if you have downloaded the source or just add the jar to ```lib``` directory and the IDE should
automatically recognize the dependency. In cases where the imports are still missing, and the dependency was not
recognized by auto, just point your build location as dependency to the project then everything should work just fine.
